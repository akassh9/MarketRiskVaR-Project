Geopolitical Risk Events and Asset Price Volatility,"Geopolitical risk events, particularly major events like military conflicts, can increase financial market volatility. This volatility can be triggered by increased uncertainty and changes in investor sentiment, potentially leading to sharp asset price corrections.","""Investors appear to price geopolitical risk into both equity and option markets to some extent. However, the realization of these risks can raise financial market volatility"" (Page 1) ; ""Overall, investors seem to factor geopolitical risk into both equity and options markets. However, surprise realizations of geopolitical risks can still lead to sharp asset price corrections and increased financial market volatility, potentially impacting investors and financial institutions, as discussed in the next section"" (Page 19)"
Sovereign Risk Premium Increases,"Major geopolitical risk events, especially international military conflicts, can lead to a widening of sovereign credit default swap (CDS) spreads, particularly in emerging market economies. This indicates increased risk aversion and concerns about fiscal sustainability.","""Sovereign risk premiums can increase notably in response to major geopolitical risk events, particularly in emerging market economies with weaker fiscal and external buffers"" (Page 1) ; ""For example, within one month of a country's involvement in a major international military conflict, sovereign CDS spreads widen by about 40 basis points in advanced economies and by about 180 basis points in emerging market economies (Figure 2.10, panel 1)"" (Page 14)"
Financial Contagion Risk,"Geopolitical risk events can spread across borders through trade and financial linkages, increasing the risk of financial contagion. This can affect firms and financial institutions in countries not directly involved in the initial event.","""The impact of geopolitical risk events can spill over to sovereigns and firms in other countries through trade and financial linkages, increasing the risk of financial contagion"" (Page 1) ; ""Geopolitical risk events transcend borders and can affect firms globally through trade linkages"" (Page 9)"
Adverse Impact on Financial Institutions,"Geopolitical risk events can negatively affect the stability and intermediation capacity of financial institutions, including banks and non-bank financial institutions. This can lead to increased market, liquidity, and credit risks.","""Geopolitical risk events can adversely affect the stability and intermediation capacity of banks and non-bank financial institutions, such as investment funds, with potential impacts on macrofinancial stability"" (Page 1) ; ""Banks and nonbank financial institutions are exposed to a multitude of risks emanating from geopolitical developments. Because adverse geopolitical risk events may trigger market volatility, elevate macroeconomic uncertainty, and disrupt economic activity (Figures 2.3 and 2.5), financial institutions, including banks and nonbanks, may face elevated market, liquidity, and credit risks during these events (April 2023 Global Financial Stability Report)"" (Page 19)"
Impact on Asset Prices,"Geopolitical risk events can have a significant impact on asset prices, leading to declines in stock prices, particularly in emerging markets. The impact can vary depending on the type of event and the characteristics of the affected countries.","""Stock prices have generally had a modest reaction to geopolitical risk events, but major events—especially military conflicts—have a disproportionally larger and more persistent effect on asset prices"" (Page 1) ; ""Overall, international military conflicts appear to affect stock prices of emerging market firms more than other types of risk events (Figure 2.6, panel 2), underlining that the severity of conflicts matters"" (Page 9)"
Macrofinancial Feedback Loop,"Geopolitical risk events can create a negative feedback loop, where asset price declines increase liquidity and credit risks for financial institutions. This can further destabilize the financial system.","""The adverse effect on asset prices can, in turn, jeopardize macrofinancial stability by affecting the liquidity and solvency of financial and nonfinancial institutions and by raising the risk of a negative macrofinancial feedback loop (Adrian and others 2019)"" (Page 2)"
Increased Downside Risks to Stock Market Returns,"Geopolitical risks increase the likelihood of large future stock market corrections, raising downside risks to stock market returns.","""An increase in geopolitical risk also raises downside risks to aggregate stock prices, defined as prices at the 10th percentile of the aggregate stock return distribution across countries (Box 2.1)"" (Page 8) ; ""The results therefore suggest that in addition to economic uncertainty, geopolitical risks increase the likelihood of large declines in stock prices, possibly through the economic channel, by affecting economic activity and the expected cash flows of firms"" (Page 25)"
Impact on Bank Capital and Lending,"Geopolitical risk events can negatively affect bank capital and lending, especially in emerging markets.","""Major geopolitical risk events generally have an adverse effect on bank capital, especially in emerging markets"" (Page 21) ; ""For example, borrower creditworthiness can deteriorate after a major domestic geopolitical risk event, and banks may cut back lending amid heightened uncertainty"" (Page 21)"
Impact on Investment Funds,"Investment funds, particularly bond funds, tend to experience lower returns and lower net flows following international military conflicts, especially if they hold securities of countries involved in the conflict.","""Investment funds, particularly bond funds, tend to experience lower returns and lower net flows, especially following international military conflicts, to the extent they ex-ante hold securities of countries involved in the conflict"" (Page 23) ; ""Investment funds with high exposures to Russia and Ukraine experience lower returns and higher outflows"" (Page 23)

**Risk Title:** Policy Uncertainty and Geopolitical Tensions Weighing on Euro Area Growth Outlook
**Summary:** The document highlights that policy uncertainty and geopolitical tensions are increasing, leading to a weaker-than-expected growth outlook for the euro area. Market participants are concerned about the potential for slower growth.
**Supporting Text:** ""In the euro area, while inflation pressures are receding, market participants are concerned about the potential for weaker than expected growth"" (Page 4); ""Alongside geopolitical and policy uncertainty, global trade tensions are on the rise, increasing the risk of tail events"" (Page 4); ""Rising policy uncertainty coupled with heightened geopolitical risks rekindles concerns about sovereign debt sustainability"" (Page 5)"
Concerns about Sovereign Debt Levels,"The document expresses concern about rising sovereign debt levels in several euro area countries, which are exacerbated by weak fiscal fundamentals and heightened policy uncertainty. This limits the policy space available to governments to respond to adverse shocks.","""Meanwhile, sovereign vulnerabilities are deepening"" (Page 4); ""Projected high levels of sovereign debt in several countries limit the policy space available for governments to respond to adverse shocks"" (Page 17); ""Rising policy uncertainty coupled with heightened geopolitical risks rekindles concerns about sovereign debt sustainability"" (Page 5)"
High Borrowing Costs and Weak Growth Prospects Putting Pressure on Corporate Balance Sheets,The document notes that high borrowing costs and weak growth prospects are putting pressure on corporate balance sheets. This is particularly concerning for commercial real estate firms and SMEs.,"""High funding costs and weak economic growth continue to affect corporate balance sheets, especially of commercial real estate (CRE) firms and SMEs"" (Page 11); ""The debt servicing capacity of SMEs appears to be particularly vulnerable to a slowdown in economic activity and higher borrowing costs"" (Page 11); ""The credit risk outlook for corporate and household portfolios remains tilted to the downside, given weak macro-financial conditions, downside risks to economic growth and the"" (Page 12)"
Market Volatility and Liquidity Fragilities in Non-Bank Financial Intermediaries (NBFI),"The document highlights that financial markets remain vulnerable to adverse dynamics, which could be amplified by non-bank liquidity fragilities. This includes stretched valuations and risk concentration in equity markets, as well as liquidity mismatches and high leverage in parts of the NBFI sector.","""Financial markets remain vulnerable to adverse dynamics which could be amplified by non-bank liquidity fragilities"" (Page 7); ""High valuations and risk concentration render financial markets susceptible to sudden, sharp adjustments, notably in equity markets"" (Page 7); ""Vulnerabilities related to liquidity mismatch and leverage in parts of the NBFI sector could amplify market-wide shocks due to forced asset sales"" (Page 5)"
Adverse Global Spillovers to Euro Area Financial Markets,"The document identifies a high risk of adverse global spillovers to euro area financial markets. This is due to the interconnectedness of global financial markets and the potential for shocks originating in other regions, such as the United States and China, to impact the euro area.","""High risk of adverse global spillovers to euro area financial markets"" (Page 2); ""A growing share of US investments, notably in US-based technology firms, makes non-bank equity portfolios more susceptible to global spillovers"" (Page 5); ""Uncertainty stemming from geopolitical tensions and economic policies remains elevated. Russia's war against Ukraine and the conflict in the Middle East continue to be the major sources of geopolitical risk. A further escalation of the tensions could have a considerable adverse impact on euro area growth"" (Page 16)"
Deteriorating Asset Quality and Increasing Provisioning Needs in the Banking Sector,"The document states that asset quality is deteriorating slowly, and provisioning needs are likely to increase in the euro area banking sector. This is driven by the most fragile credit segments, including commercial real estate, SMEs, and consumer credit.","""Asset quality is deteriorating slowly and provisioning needs are likely to increase"" (Page 2); ""Aggregate asset quality is continuing to deteriorate slowly from the historically low levels of non-performing loan (NPL) ratios, driven by the most fragile credit segments"" (Page 52); ""CRE and consumer credit segments have deteriorated, but exposures are contained in aggregate"" (Page 53)"
Weak Productivity and its Impact on Financial Stability,"The document discusses the issue of low firm productivity and its impact on financial stability. It highlights that the supply of bank credit has tilted more towards less-productive firms in recent years, which is a concern.","""Low firm productivity: the role of finance and the implications for financial stability"" (Page 3); ""Overall, the supply of bank credit has tilted more towards less-productive firms in recent years"" (Page 116); ""These findings beg the question as to whether more-productive firms have been to some degree crowded out, to the detriment of economic growth and resilience"" (Page 116)

**Risk Title:** Valuation Pressures in Asset Markets
**Summary:** Asset prices are high relative to economic fundamentals or historical norms, driven by investors' increased risk appetite. This can lead to outsized drops in asset prices.
**Supporting Text:** ""Valuation pressures arise when asset prices are high relative to economic fundamentals or historical norms. These developments are often driven by an increased willingness of investors to take on risk. As such, elevated valuation pressures may increase the possibility of outsized drops in asset prices (see Section 1, Asset Valuations)"""
Excessive Borrowing by Businesses and Households,"High debt burdens can lead to businesses and households cutting back spending if incomes decline or assets fall in value, affecting economic activity and causing losses for investors.","""Excessive borrowing by businesses and households exposes the borrowers to distress if their incomes decline or the assets they own fall in value. In these cases, businesses and households with high debt burdens may need to cut back spending, affecting economic activity and causing losses for investors (see Section 2, Borrowing by Businesses and Households)"""
Excessive Leverage in the Financial Sector,High leverage in the financial sector increases the risk that financial institutions will not be able to absorb losses without disrupting normal business operations when hit by adverse shocks. This can lead to reduced lending and further economic weakness.,"""Excessive leverage within the financial sector increases the risk that financial institutions will not have the ability to absorb losses without disruptions to their normal business operations when hit by adverse shocks. In those situations, institutions will be forced to cut back lending, sell their assets, or even shut down. Such responses can impair credit access for households and businesses, further weakening economic activity (see Section 3, Leverage in the Financial Sector)"""
Funding Risks,"Investors may rapidly withdraw funds from a particular institution or sector, creating strains across markets. This can lead to fire sales of assets, losses, and potential insolvency.","""Funding risks expose the financial system to the possibility that investors will rapidly withdraw their funds from a particular institution or sector, creating strains across markets or institutions.
