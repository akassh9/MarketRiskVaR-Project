The IMF has flagged widening sovereign CDS spreads—especially in emerging‑market and lower‑rated jurisdictions—as a precursor to broader credit and equity sell‑offs. When risk premia blow out, it often cascades into corporate credit, emerging equities, and even “risk‑free” government bonds in some markets.",

Analysts repeatedly flag “policy uncertainty and geopolitical tensions weighing on euro‑area growth,” sovereign debt sustainability concerns, and spillover risks to global markets. With the ECB navigating uneven inflation and growth dynamics, a policy‑driven shock is very topical—and very different in its cross‑asset fingerprint from a Fed‑centric event.",
